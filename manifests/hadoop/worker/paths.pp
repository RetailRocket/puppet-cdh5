# == Define cdh5::hadoop::worker::paths
#
# Ensures directories needed for Hadoop Worker nodes
# are created with proper ownership and permissions.
# This has to be a define so that we can pass the
# $datanode_mounts array as a group.  (Puppet doesn't
# support iteration.)
#
# You should probably create each $basedir yourself before you
# this define is used.  Each $basedir is expected to be a JBOD
# mount point that Hadoop will use to store data in.  This define
# does not manage creating or mounting any partitions.
#
# == Parameters:
# $basedir   - base path for directory creation.  Default: $title
#
# == Usage:
# cdh5::hadoop::worker::paths { ['/mnt/hadoop/data/a', '/mnt/hadoop/data/b']: }
#
# The above declaration will ensure that the following directory hierarchy exists:
#       /mnt/hadoop/data/a
#       /mnt/hadoop/data/a/hdfs
#       /mnt/hadoop/data/a/hdfs/dn
#       /mnt/hadoop/data/a/yarn
#       /mnt/hadoop/data/a/yarn/local
#       /mnt/hadoop/data/a/yarn/logs
#       /mnt/hadoop/data/b
#       /mnt/hadoop/data/b/hdfs
#       /mnt/hadoop/data/b/hdfs/dn
#       /mnt/hadoop/data/b/yarn
#       /mnt/hadoop/data/b/yarn/local
#       /mnt/hadoop/data/b/yarn/logs
#
# (If you use MRv1 instead of yarn, the hierarchy will be slightly different.)
